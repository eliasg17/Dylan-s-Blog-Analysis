# Data Analysis on the data of a fictional online business called Dylan's Blog using SQL and Python.

This fictional blog is a travel guide which sells two products, an $8 e-book, and an $80 video course. Dylan writes about 6 main categories, and has readers from 8 different countries. The new readers are coming from three different sources: AdWords, Reddit and SEO.

As part of the Data36 Junior Data Scientist Online Course assignment, I analyzed the data of the fictional blog and gave advice for the future.
I performed various analyzes on the data using SQL and Python and summarized my results in a presentation. For the visualization I used PowerBI as well.
